What is the area of your research in your proposed project idea? What is your specific
proposed idea and why is it important? Motivate with references as relevant.

1.  Area of Research : 
      - Image Classification
      - Neural Networks
      
    Proposed Idea : Neural network that can seperate videos into categories based on similarity.
      - Important for data organization
      

What is already known in the literature about this problem area; where does your projectâ€™s
concentration of your own interests lie in this area? What goals have you set for this project?
Motivate with references as relevant.
      
2.  Image classification models
      - Dall-E
      - CoCa
      - CaiT-M
    Convolutional Neural Networks
      - Optimized for image classification
      
    Goals for project : 
      1. Learn more about convolutional neural networks.
      2. Develop network to classify videos.
      

What is the Gap between the field and the knowledge of the area? Why is this gap present
and what are the implications of the gap and what is your solution to try to bridge this gap?
Motivate with references as relevant.
      
3.  Lots of image classification, not as much video classification.
      Ex) Youtube search recommendation, which can be faulty
      
    The reason for the gap :
      > Videos have many changing scenes making finding similarities more complex compared to single images.
      
    Solution for gap : 
      > Find a way to compare objects and content in one video with another.
      
      
Using specifics, what is/are the research question(s) that motivate your research project?
      
4.  Research Questions : 
      1. "How to train an AI to recognize differences between videos?"
      2. "How to format frames from a video into a single piece of data to input into a neural network?"
      

Discuss the scope and feasibility of this work. For instance, what are the limits in your area
of research? How far do you indent to follow this research question?
      
5.  Scope: Variable scope depending on accuracy wanted and the training dataset size associated with it.
  
    Feasibility: Since project will be a basic version of my idea the scope will be smaller than a more complex model.
      - There are two reasons for creating a more basic model : 
          1. Computational limits
          2. Time Constraints


Discuss the prototype you developed to demonstrate feasibility. Give an overview of its
design and implementation. Discuss any data and existing software/libraries/tools that were
necessary for the development of your prototype.

6.  Prototype : A tool to download types of videos from youtube and extract a set amount of frames from each video.

      Design : Terminal interface with options presented to user to run.
      
      Libraries used : 
            1. youtubesearchpython
            2. opencv-python
            3. youtube-dl
            4. yt-dlp


What evidence is there that the prototype will provide any support for your project? How
will your prototype be helpful in the planning, execution and completion of your research
project?

7.  Reasoning for prototype : 

      - Will need video data for training the AI.
      - Will need an efficient tool to extract frames from the video data.
      - The prototype makes organizing the data much faster than doing it manually.
   
   
Discuss the experiment that you performed involving the prototype. What were the hypotheses and research question(s) of your experiment and what steps were taken to respond to
them?
   
8.  Experiment : "What type of image processing algorithm should I create to use on the frames from my prototype in order to train my network correctly?"

      Ideas:
            1. Average frames together to check for similarities in color between the videos.
            2. Get the difference between frames to check for similar changes in shape and camera movement in the videos. (content in video)
            
      - With these ideas, I developed two models to check both the average color in a video and the shape changes in a video.
      
      - Used generated image data for the experiment to test simpler data first.


Discuss the results of the experiment. What was learned from applying these steps which will
be helpful to the completion of your projec and the achieving the main goals of your research
project?

9.  Experiment Results : 20 Training Stages
      Color checking AI accuracy : 100%
      Content checking AI accuracy : 96%
      
      - With these results, my ideas for checking the similarities in videos seemed to work, so I moved onto the next part of my project.


How did you explain and visualize your results from your experiment so that they could be
understood by those who are not in your field of research? Explain how these visualizations
could be used in your research project to help explain its foundations.

10.  Experiment Visualization : Screenshots of training output results
      
      - Shows accuracy and loss of each step in the training process.
      

What ethical concerns are involved with your research? How will you recognize them and
how will you handle them once they are apparent?

11.  Ethical Concerns

      1. Training relies on using data that is not owned by the developer.
      2. A more powerful version of this project could be used for censorship or misinformation by scanning for and removing videos online.
      
      - Issue 1 could be solved by filming training data yourself rather than downloading videos online.
      - Issue 2 has no permanent efficient prevention measure as solutions to the issue could be reversed.
      
      
What are the next steps to develop and complete your research project.
      
12.  Next Steps : 

      1.  Improve the model
            - Black and white conversion of content model data to prevent issues with color in frames appearing (Perhaps performing edge detection on frames)
            - Average the frames for the content model training dataset
            - Train with more data
                 > More videos
                 > More frames loaded per video
      
       2.  Better Interface
            - Implement a GUI for easier use of the network for training and testing purposes
