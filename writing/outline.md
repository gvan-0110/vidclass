1.  Area of Research : 
      - Image Classification
      - Neural Networks
      
    Proposed Idea : Neural network that can seperate videos into categories based on similarity.
      - Important for data organization
      
2.  Image classification models
      - Dall-E
      - CoCa
      - CaiT-M
    Convolutional Neural Networks
      - Optimized for image classification
      
    Goals for project : 
      1. Learn more about convolutional neural networks.
      2. Develop network to classify videos.
      
3.  Lots of image classification, not as much video classification.
      Ex) Youtube search recommendation, which can be faulty
      
    The reason for the gap :
      > Videos have many changing scenes making finding similarities more complex compared to single images.
      
    Solution for gap : 
      > Find a way to compare objects and content in one video with another.
      
4.  Research Questions : 
      1. "How to train an AI to recognize differences between videos?"
      2. "How to format frames from a video into a single piece of data to input into a neural network?"
      
5.  Scope: Variable scope depending on accuracy wanted and the training dataset size associated with it.
  
    Feasibility: Since project will be a basic version of my idea the scope will be smaller than a more complex model.
      - There are two reasons for creating a more basic model : 
          1. Computational limits
          2. Time Constraints
