Interview with Simon J

**Questions Answered**

1. The area of interest is quantum information / quantum computing.  The reason for this interest is the sudden influx of research in photonics.

2. The literature seen so far is dealing with algorithms in this field already and reading textbooks that dealt with the subject such as quantum physics and linear algebra.  There were also reviews on quantum information that he read so far.  The goal for the project is to create the four possible bell states.  The bell states measure the probability of finding a photon in a state.

3. The gap is the knowledge and application of the algorithms that he wants to explore, and not having built a system in a field like this so far.  There is also the GAP of not having worked in the quantum information field yet, however, he has been using Qiskit so far to bridge this gap and this library is used for simulating the circuits used virtually in this field.

4. How can we best implement quantum algorithms is the main research question fueling the project.

5. The prototype took a set of data points and tried to calculate the periodicity of those data points.  Basically, if you added up a set of sin waves, what would the frequency of those sin waves be?  Some software used the Julia programming language and Bash scripting, and JavaScript for visual representation.  However, the prototype will not be used in the final iteration of the project since it was used to become familiar with the fourier transform.

6. The experiment for the project was imputing more waveforms into the program and timing the program to see if it took longer or not.  The time linearly increased which means the computational time was a constant slope.

7.  To visualize the results, plotlyJS was used to create smooth curves in the browser.

8. There aren't any ethical concerns since it is quite far from being used in the industry currently.

9.  The final steps are to take 2 more courses in quantum physics and information theory and take more courses when abroad to learn more about this field.

**Recommendations from questions:**

1. Make sure to discuss the math behind the project really well since others in the computer science field who don't have experience with quantum physics will have a hard time understanding the project if the math isn't explained from the basics.
